# Apex Legends Tracker
Track somebody's stats on Apex Legends.
<br>
<br>
You can very easy change the chosen game. Let's say you want Fortnite instead, goto config.env and change the `https://public-api.tracker.gg/v2/apex/standard` to `https://public-api.tracker.gg/v2/fortnite/standard`. Then in the Profile.vue change all the segments to the segments Fortnite has and update the Search.vue and the other files.
